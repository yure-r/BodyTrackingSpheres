Most of this project, as it stands, was exported from Glitch. 

All of the files that are necessary for this project are in the main branch! The easiest and fastest ways to get this project up and running for yourself, would be to import this repo into a glitch project. 

To do so you would:
1. Visit https://glitch.com and create an account.
2. Click on "new project" and at the bottom of that dropdown, click "import from GitHub" 
3. Change the url to https://github.com/yure-r/BodyTrackingSpheres
4. Glitch will automatically clone the "main" branch into the project. 

To view and experince your own instance of the body tracking spheres on desktop, open https://[YOUR GLITCH PROJECT NAME].glitch.me/index-window.html to view the mirror of your body, and https://[YOUR GLITCH PROJECT].glitch.me/socket-viewer.html to view the socket data of your pose mirror, broadcasted live over the internet. 

The index-window.html file creates a web demo and body tracking socket instance of your pose data.
The socket-viewer.html file allows you (or anyone) to view the socket data on any device with internet access.
